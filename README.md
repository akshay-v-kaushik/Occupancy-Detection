# Occupancy Detection
Occupancy of an office room prediction 

### Introduction:-

Previous studies showed that knowing occupancy certainly can save energy in the control system of building. Here, Ground-truth occupancy is obtained from time-stamped pictures of environmental variables like temperature, humidity, light, CO2 were taken every minute. The implementation of an ML algorithm instead of a physical PIR sensor will be cost and maintenance-free.  In this regard, occupancy detection has a significant role in many smart building applications such as heating, cooling,
ventilation (HVAC) and lighting system.
